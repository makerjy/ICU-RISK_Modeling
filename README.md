This repository is part of the project:

ICU Risk Prediction Pipeline (MIMIC-IV)  
Main project page: https://github.com/makerjy/ICU-Risk-Prediction

## Position in Pipeline

Step: Feature Engineering & Modeling

Role in project:
- Build reproducible preprocessing pipelines
- Handle extreme class imbalance (class_weight, SMOTE)
- Train baseline ML models
- Evaluate ensemble strategies

Models included:
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive Bayes
- Soft / Weighted Voting Ensemble

Next step:
- Validation pipelines for robustness checks
  (REALMIP_ValidModel_ML, REALMIP_MIMIC_IV_imputation_cmp)
